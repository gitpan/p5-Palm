2000-11-09  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.2.4 released.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Applied John-David Smith's patch: add the "archive"
	attribute. Better check for non-NULLness of AppInfo block.

2000-09-25  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Added "launchable" attribute, for PQAs.

	* util/pdbdump: Added "launchable" attribute, for PQAs. Print
	database attributes more clearly.

	* Palm/PQA.pm: First draft of PQA parser.

2000-09-24  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* util/pdbdump: Now handles resource databases as well as record
	databases.

	* Palm/ToDo.pm, Palm/StdAppInfo.pm, Palm/Raw.pm, Palm/PDB.pm,
	Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Datebook.pm, Palm/Address.pm:
	$VERSION is now a floating-point number, for comparison.

2000-09-16  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.2.3 released.

	* Palm/PDB.pm (bug fix): The two useless NULs are allowed, but not
	mandated, by the spec. By assuming that they will always be there,
	this module failed to parse some well-formed PDBs.

	* util/pdbdump: Oops! Forgot to fix resources. Minor cleaning.

	* util/pdbdump (bug fix): The two useless NULs are allowed, but
	not mandated, by the spec. By assuming that they will always be
	there, 'pdbdump' failed to parse some well-formed PDBs.

2000-09-09  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.2.2 released.

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Added $error variable.
	(bug fix): A mis-written test would cause &pack_StdAppInfo to omit
	unnamed categories. Hence, the category list had fewer than 16
	categories, when written. Fixed typo.
	(feature): Added &addCategory, &deleteCategory, &renameCategory.
	Removed BUGS section.

2000-09-08  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Stop Perl from complaining if there are
	unnamed categories.

	* README: Added author.

2000-08-28  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.2.1 released.

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Changed API: the categories are new arranged
	as a 16-element array of category structs, the way they logically
	belong, rather than as disparate arrays, the way they're
	represented in the file. Added a lot to the POD.

2000-08-24  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Clarified pod somewhat.

	* util/pdbdump (feature): Expands arrays of hash references
	recursively.

2000-08-13  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>
	
	- Version 1.2.0 released.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Incorporated changes suggested by John
	Jannotti <jj@lcs.mit.edu>, to avoid warnings under Perl 5.6, when
	various fields are undefined.

	* Palm/ToDo.pm, Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Datebook.pm,
	Palm/Address.pm: Updated for new &parse_StdAppInfo behavior.

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm (bug fix): &parse_StdAppInfo now puts the
	non-category part of the AppInfo block in $appinfo->{other}. This
	is so that a script that reads a random .pdb file as a StdAppInfo
	(and nothing else) can copy it without loss of data.
	&pack_StdAppInfo uses $appinfo->{other}. Clarified documentation
	somewhat.

2000-08-04  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Fixed expression that made 'perl5.6 -w' print a
	warning. Fix submitted by John Jannotti <jj@lcs.mit.edu>.

2000-08-01  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.12 released.

	* util/pdbdump (bug fix): Read files in binary mode under Windows,
	MS-DOS, and other OSes that make that distinction.

	* Palm/PDB.pm (bug fix): Read and write files in binary mode under
	Windows, MS-DOS, and other OSes that make that distinction.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Delete raw data field at the end of
	&ParseRecord.

2000-07-20  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.11 released.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm (Bug fix): Test for undefined record fields, to
	avoid warnings with databases built from scratch. Patch supplied
	by <kkeller@sirius.com>.

2000-07-19  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.10 released.
	
2000-07-18  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/ToDo.pm, Palm/PDB.pm, Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Mail.pm,
	Palm/Datebook.pm, Palm/Address.pm: Clarified the documentation for
	&new_Record.
	
2000-07-08  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: PDB::new now initializes more fields. PDB::Write
	prints a warning if writing a zero-length record.
	PDB::new_Resource: type now defaults to all NULs (instead of four
	spaces).

2000-06-30  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.9 released

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Made AppInfo block initialization the same as
	other modules, even though Datebook doesn't really use categories
	and such.

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm (bug fix): Use of anonymous array instead of
	a real array caused first category (and first category ID) to be a
	reference rather than a "real" scalar.

2000-05-23  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.8 released.

	* Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Address.pm (bug fix): Don't run
	StdAppInfo::import(). This prevents StdAppInfo from registering
	itself as the default handler in generic tools.

2000-05-13  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.7 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

	* Palm/Mail.pm: Fixed inconsistency in record member names
	("replyTo" was sometimes "reply_to", and "sentTo" was sometimes
	"sent_to"). Patch supplied by Sumant S.R. Oemrawsingh
	<sikander@stad.dsl.nl>

	- Version 1.1.6 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Incremented patch level. Added "pdbdump" to the
	distribution.

	* MANIFEST: Ship "pdbdump" instead of "dumpdb".

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Added an import() function, so you can say
	that a function is a Palm::StdAppInfo.

	* Palm/Mail.pm (bug fix): Palm::Mail::new_Record() didn't return a
	value (bug found by Sumant S.R. Oemrawsingh
	<sikander@stad.dsl.nl>).
	Don't import StdAppInfo, since don't want new PDBs to default to
	StdAppInfo.

2000-05-08  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* util/pdbdump: Rewritten from scratch. This is basically just
	Palm/PDB.pm with trace statements.

2000-05-07  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/Raw.pm: Added `use strict'. Rearranged some variables at
	the top.

	* Palm/Raw.pm, Palm/ToDo.pm, Palm/StdAppInfo.pm, Palm/PDB.pm,
	Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Datebook.pm: Removed unnecessary
	quoting in class members.

2000-05-06  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/Address.pm: Removed unnecessary quoting in class members.

	* Palm/ToDo.pm: Converted to use StdAppInfo.

	* Palm/Raw.pm, Palm/PDB.pm, Palm/ToDo.pm: Fixed man page sections
	for "see also" section.

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm (added) Class for dealing with the standard
	part of AppInfo blocks
	(category support).

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Uses `use strict'. Changed the way $VERSION is
	generated from RCS tag. Fixed the POD a bit.

	* Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Datebook.pm, Palm/Address.pm:
	Use StdAppInfo.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Fixed manual section numbers.

	* MANIFEST: Added "TODO", "StdAppInfo.pm"

2000-04-20  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/Mail.pm: Forgot to mention the subject in the
	documentation.

2000-02-01  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 1.1.2 released.

	* TODO (added): Things that need to be done.

	* README (added): README file.

	* Palm/Raw.pm: Rearranged the POD. Inherit &new, &new_Record
	methods.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/ToDo.pm:
	Rearranged the POD. Added &new, &new_Record methods.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Added placeholder for
	$pdb->{appinfo}{lastUniqueID}.

	* Added $VERSION variable to all .pm files, per CPAN.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Renamed &deleteRecord to &delete_Record, for
	consistency. &append_Record, &append_Resource, &delete_Record
	update PDB's mtime.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Moved pod documentation to be adjacent to the
	code, instead of at the end. Fixed &new so there are always 16
	categories, one of which is named "Unfiled" with code 0.

2000-01-23  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: The various _load_*() functions are no longer
	methods, since they shouldn't be overridden anyway. Added
	documentation for new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

	* util/dumpdb: Bug fix: deal with PDBs without records, and PRCs
	without resources. Memo: Dump() now prints the AppInfo and sort
	blocks, if they exist. Address: Dump() now prints the field labels
	in the AppInfo block. Address: print the record attributes.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Updated copyright. Fixed function cross-references
	in the documentation. new() method now initializes the common
	fields. Fiddled with quotes in the documentation some more.
	Write() method now supplies the two NULs if they're missing. Added
	methods: new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_Resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

	* Palm/Address.pm: Added new() method, to specifically create a
	new Address PDB. Added new_Record() method, to create a new
	Address record.
	Bug fix: PackAppInfoBlock() only packed whichever
	categories were defined. It now makes sure that it packs 16
	categories.

	* Makefile.PL: Incremented version.

1999-12-05  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/Address.pm: Fixed documentation to reflect reality.

	reflect the fact that the Palm stuff is in Palm::<foo>, not
	Palm::PDB::<foo>.

	* util/copydb: Added RCS header. Took out the "use lib" line, for
	now. Changed "use" statements: the Palm stuff is no longer
	Palm::PDB:<foo>, but rather Palm::<foo>.

	* util/dumpdb: Test utility to dump the contents of a PDB.

	* util/copydb: Test utility to copy a PDB.
