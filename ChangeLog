2000-04-29  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* README: Added Robert Norris's patch for empty PDBs.

2000-04-24  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	Version 1.1.3 released.

	* util/pdbdump (added) This will eventually become the successor
	to dumpdb.

	* util/dumpdb: More AppInfo block processing.

	* Palm/StdAppInfo.pm (added) Class for dealing with the standard
	part of AppInfo blocks
	(category support).

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Uses `use strict'. Changed the way $VERSION is
	generated from RCS tag. Fixed the POD a bit.

	* Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Datebook.pm, Palm/Address.pm:
	Use StdAppInfo.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Fixed manual section numbers.

	* MANIFEST: Added "TODO", "StdAppInfo.pm"

2000-04-20  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/Mail.pm: Forgot to mention the subject in the
	documentation.

2000-02-01  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	Version 1.1.2 released.

	* TODO (added): Things that need to be done.

	* README (added): README file.

	* Palm/Raw.pm: Rearranged the POD. Inherit &new, &new_Record
	methods.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm, Palm/Mail.pm, Palm/Memo.pm, Palm/ToDo.pm:
	Rearranged the POD. Added &new, &new_Record methods.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Added placeholder for
	$pdb->{appinfo}{lastUniqueID}.

	* Added $VERSION variable to all .pm files, per CPAN.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Renamed &deleteRecord to &delete_Record, for
	consistency. &append_Record, &append_Resource, &delete_Record
	update PDB's mtime.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Moved pod documentation to be adjacent to the
	code, instead of at the end. Fixed &new so there are always 16
	categories, one of which is named "Unfiled" with code 0.

2000-01-23  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: The various _load_*() functions are no longer
	methods, since they shouldn't be overridden anyway. Added
	documentation for new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

	* util/dumpdb: Bug fix: deal with PDBs without records, and PRCs
	without resources. Memo: Dump() now prints the AppInfo and sort
	blocks, if they exist. Address: Dump() now prints the field labels
	in the AppInfo block. Address: print the record attributes.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Updated copyright. Fixed function cross-references
	in the documentation. new() method now initializes the common
	fields. Fiddled with quotes in the documentation some more.
	Write() method now supplies the two NULs if they're missing. Added
	methods: new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_Resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

	* Palm/Address.pm: Added new() method, to specifically create a
	new Address PDB. Added new_Record() method, to create a new
	Address record.
	Bug fix: PackAppInfoBlock() only packed whichever
	categories were defined. It now makes sure that it packs 16
	categories.

	* Makefile.PL: Incremented version.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Fixed documentation to reflect reality.

1999-11-18  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Added magic $VERSION, to make CPAN happy.

	* util/dumpdb: Took out Bitmaps and DopeWars, since those aren't
	part of the distribution (yet?).

	* MANIFEST: Added README.

	* Palm/Raw.pm: Clarified the use of "use Palm::Raw;" vs. "use
	Palm::Raw();" in the documentation.

	* Palm/ToDo.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Palm/Raw.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Palm/Memo.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Palm/Mail.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Changed Palm::PDB::<foo> to Palm::<foo> where
	required.

	* Makefile.PL: Changed distribution name to p5-Palm, for clarity.
	Explicitly set installation method.

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed NAME and VERSION.

	* MANIFEST: Removed Palm/Makefile.PL

	* MANIFEST: Fixed after directory shuffle.

	* test.pl: Generated by MakeMaker. Not used.

	* util/dumpdb: Added RCS comment. Updated "use" statements to
	reflect the fact that the Palm stuff is in Palm::<foo>, not
	Palm::PDB::<foo>.

	* util/copydb: Added RCS header. Took out the "use lib" line, for
	now. Changed "use" statements: the Palm stuff is no longer
	Palm::PDB:<foo>, but rather Palm::<foo>.

	* util/dumpdb: Test utility to dump the contents of a PDB.

	* util/copydb: Test utility to copy a PDB.

	* Palm/ToDo.pm: Module for dealing with ToDo databases.

	* Palm/Raw.pm: Module for dealing with "Raw" databases.

	* Palm/Memo.pm: Module for dealing with Memo databases.

	* Palm/Mail.pm: Module for dealing with Mail databases.

	* Palm/Datebook.pm: Module for dealing with DateBook databases.

	* Palm/Address.pm: Module for dealing with AddressBook databases.

	* Palm/PDB.pm: Base module for dealing with PDBs.
